# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! This repository contains my solutions for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenges, spanning all problems from **Day 1** to **Day 25**.

## ðŸ“š About Advent of Code  
Advent of Code is an annual series of programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to 25th. These challenges are designed to improve problem-solving and coding skills while providing a festive way to code during the holiday season.

## Repository Structure  
Each day's challenge is organized into its own folder, containing:

- **`input.txt`**: The input data for the challenge.
- **`solution.py`** (or relevant file): My solution to the problem.
- Additional files as needed (e.g., explanatory comments, alternate approaches).

The structure is as follows:

â”œâ”€â”€ Day 1/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt â”‚ â””â”€â”€ solution.py 
â”œâ”€â”€ Day 2/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt â”‚ â””â”€â”€ solution.py
